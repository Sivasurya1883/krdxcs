                    <h2>E-Commerce</h2>
                    <p>E-commerce, commonly known as online shopping, refers to a type of internet-based business where all transactions are conducted over the web. In recent times, online buying and selling have become widely popular and have emerged as a prominent trend in the world of commerce. Whether you're selling books, cars, electronics, groceries, or offering services, there's a solution to facilitate online sales. At krdx.cs, we take the time to understand and assess your business before crafting an online presence. We offer a range of e-commerce solutions based on open source frameworks, including Magento Commerce, Zencart, Opencart, Oscommerce, Virtuemart, WP-Ecommerce, X-cart, and more. Our choice of framework is determined after a thorough analysis of each customer's specific business needs. Additionally, we also provide custom solutions where we build your store from the ground up using either PHP or .net, tailored to your exact requirements.</p>

                    <h2>Web Applications</h2>
                    <p>If you find yourself in need of a versatile application to oversee projects, manage time sheets, handle cash flow, track stocks, process orders, send out newsletters, and more, we have solutions to meet all these requirements. Bring us your concepts, and we'll turn them into functional web applications. We specialize in developing and deploying web applications for both internet and intranet use. Web applications offer distinct advantages over desktop-based counterparts; they don't necessitate installation and only require a web browser for users (including staff, customers, students, and others). These applications are centralized, allowing for access from any location and device. Our expertise lies in utilizing PHP, .net, HTML5, AJAX, Flash platform, SQL, MySQL, and other widely-used languages and tools for web application development. Additionally, we're equipped to assist in the customization of your existing web application, whether it's one we've developed or purchased from other vendors. In many cases, our dedicated resources model proves to be the most suitable approach for fulfilling web application development needs.</p>

                    <h2>Web Design & Development</h2>
                    <p>In the contemporary landscape of the internet, websites are a crucial and fundamental component for the growth of any business. Recognizing this, we at KRDX are dedicated to delivering the most suitable solutions tailored to our clients' specific needs. With over a decade of professional expertise in web technologies, KRDX stands as a trailblazer in the field of web design and development. Leveraging the latest technologies available, we've successfully completed over 2000 website projects worldwide. We understand that not every business requires online commerce, a learning management system, article publishing capabilities, or social networking features. If all you need is a web presence, we can help you plan and create a straightforward website. Additionally, if you already have an impressive website but it isn't optimized for mobile, we can assist in developing a separate mobile-friendly version. Feel free to reach out with any uncertainties, and we'll provide expert guidance. At KRDX, our process begins with conceptualizing the initial website requirements, followed by presenting visual design concepts. We continue refining these concepts until the client's requirements are fully met and satisfied.</p>

                    <p>E-Learning has been a cornerstone of KRDX's focus since its inception. Given the predominant digital environment we operate in, the approach to learning has evolved to keep pace with the ever-changing digital landscape. With years of expertise, we've been delivering e-Learning solutions to clients worldwide, spanning diverse business domains and requirements. E-Learning isn't just vital in educational institutions; it's also pivotal for corporate entities in their pursuit of business growth. Terms like CBT (Computer-Based Training), IBT (Internet-Based Training), and WBT (Web-Based Training) are often used interchangeably with e-learning. At KRDX, we excel in tailoring Open Source Learning Management Systems like Moodle, and we're equally adept at building custom Learning Management Systems from the ground up. With a substantial team dedicated to rich media content authoring, we're equipped to handle a significant volume of courses simultaneously.</p>

                    <h2>Flash to HTML5 Conversion</h2>
                    <p>Since the advent of the mobile era, many companies have turned to HTML5 for the front-end development of their new web applications, while others have embarked on the journey of migrating or upgrading their existing content from Flash (or basic HTML) to HTML5. At KRDX, we facilitate this process by obtaining the existing Flash content from the client and employing a suitable Flash to HTML framework to restructure and reorganize it, ensuring compatibility with HTML5. This expedites the conversion process, simplifying the developer's task. The resulting HTML5 content maintains all aspects of the original Flash content, including its visual design, richness, graphics, and more. The newly converted HTML5 content is designed to meet the diverse usability requirements of various screen sizes on both mobile devices and desktops. Moreover, HTML5 content can be optimized to be lightweight, supporting even low-end mobile devices while utilizing only minimal device resources. Our Flash to HTML5 conversion process adheres to necessary standards, guaranteeing that the new content renders correctly as per the specified requirements.</p>
